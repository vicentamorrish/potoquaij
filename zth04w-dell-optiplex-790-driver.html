                            <p>Здравствуйте, не могу определиться между начинкой ноутбука Lenovo Ideapad 700-15. Хотелось бы конечно все максимально лучшее, но упираюсь в опеределенный бюджет. Get drivers and downloads for your Dell OptiPlex 790. Download and install the latest drivers, firmware and software. Hi /r/computertechs I sell alot of refurb equipment to small offices that just need a reliable web/email/MSOffice machine. For the past few years my goto has been the Optiplex 780 SFF with a Core2Duo E8500, 4GB RAM, and Win7Pro. Relatively cheap, powerful enough for my customers, and they have room for a video card and PCI wifi if needed. It is getting a little dated though, and I've been looking at moving on to a newer system and higher specs. In the refurb market more recent Optiplex. So I'm trying to get myself to a ZeroTouch stage.I'm deploying a Win10 image to a bunch of Optiplex 9010's, 9020's and hopefully 790's. I've successfully setup the drivers to inject based of the CAB files available from Dell. These install all the latest drivers for everything EXCEPT the correct video driver (installing the Microsoft Basic Video Adaptor). I believe the problem lays in that the Radeon card that's in these machines was an optional upgrade. Connecting the 9010 to the internet. Download the latest drivers for your Dell OptiPlex 790 to keep your Computer up-to-date. I'll put the TLDR here first; My new setup uses the graphics card from my old setup, but has worse gaming performance despite almost every other component being newer and faster. Long Version; My old setup was nothing special, it was a Dell Optiplex 790 mini-tower that I threw some RAM and a GTX 970 into. My OLD setup specs: i5 2400, 3.1GHz quad core Geforce GTX 970 8 gigs DDR3 RAM @2400 Hz Whatever standard mATX motherboard came with the Optiplex 790 Windows 10 Pro 500GB Настольный компьютер Dell OptiPlex 790 — получите повышенную производительность, простоту управления и гибкую конструкцию благодаря настольному компьютеру OptiPlex. \ Running off of a dell optiplex 790\ Specs: Rx570 4gb XFX black ed. i5 2400 @ stock speeds temps are normal, when i run cinebench 20 it hovers around 60-65 degrees Stock cooler with pc 8GB of corsair XMS3 Ram 550w psu OK so here's the TLDR, even on CSGO my performance is absolutely awful, like massive frame dips and other such factors that make any game i play unplayable except for Diablo 3 for some reason?

Within the past week I've upgraded my pc significantly. Ive swapped into ssd and a 400w pcu while using my old gtx 760, was running OW at ~40 fps at moderate settings. Today tries installing the 1050ti, immediate problems even getting it recognized. Had to download old drivers to get it recognized, tried OW, performance was booty. Tried updating drivers via geforce experience. Worse. Also, GPU showing a MASSIVE power draw. Is it my drivers? Any ideas welcome. Edit: Current build: This article is a guide to those drivers needed to run a Dell OptiPlex 790 system running the Windows 7 operating system. Hello, I recently bought a gtx 1070 to replace my gtx 970. I plugged it in this morning and have no display at all. I took it out and plugged in my rx 460 and it worked fine. I plugged in my gtx 970, which also requires an 8 pin pcie connector, and it worked. The rx 460 runs on motherboard power. Is it something to do with drivers or something. The fans spin, it is securely in place, and have tried dvi, hdmi, and display ports with no luck. The onboard vga port will display 
Download latest Dell Optiplex 790 drivers for Windows 10, 7, 8 / 8.1, Vista, XP. Only official versions. I just got a new RX 560 from here: https://www.amazon.com/MSI-RX-560-AERO-ITX/dp/B072J422CZ The reviews said it had fine Linux support, so I bought it. When I tried to install it I noticed a few things: On DP to HDMI it displayed the BIOS bootup screen. But after the boot screen was over the screen went black and stayed black. Still on DP-HDMI when trying to install another OS (I tried Manjaro and Linux Mint) it displayed the bootup screen but not the Live CD thing where you actually install. Windows Explorer supports native viewing of CAB contents. Users can also use WinZip to examine the contents So, I’m CompTia A+ certified and even I’m stumped with this problem. Ran memtest and got no errors so I’m assuming it’s not a CPU/RAM issue. I’m assuming it’s not a PSU issue because otherwise the PC would just completely shut off as opposed to locking up. PC played just about anything I wanted to throw at it for a year and a half until now. I’ve got the latest drivers, CPU/GPU/RAM are barely over half load and the temps seem fine. It doesn’t matter the game(or the settings) the problem. Ottieni driver e download per il tuo Dell OptiPlex 790.

Windows 7 was already on the SSD from an old build and booted just fine, had to reboot a few times getting new drivers. But when I plugged in the HDD and formatted it, I accidentally clicked and made it an “active” partition.

So I'm running on a Dell Optiplex 790 MT. I have a SSD as my Win10 boot drive and when it's the only storage plugged in, it boots lightning quick and works just fine. I want to use a 1TB HDD as a storage drive. However, when I have both drives plugged into the motherboard the computer seems to go into an endless Windows loading screen, as if it were searching for the proper boot drive. I've gone into my (legacy) BIOS plenty of times and verified the SSD is first on the list of boot devices. Бесплатные драйверы для Dell OptiPlex 790.

These Optiplex are known to work well with Nvidia GPUs. However, its been reported that Optiplex have compatibility issues with AMD 400 and RX 500 series GPUs. Information on the exact incompatibility problem isn't very clear, but from what I can gather: AMD GPUs won't work if booting in legacy mode with these Optiplexes.

I've tried going to the manufacturer's website and updating all bios, utilities, drivers etc. The issue wasn't solved. I also tried a reformat of my Windows 10 OS, with no success. I've tried unplugging practically everything from my motherboard and testing if it would be stable (RAM, Boot HDD, GPU, Monitors, Peripherals, etc), still no dice. So I figure there's just no more tests or solutions.
